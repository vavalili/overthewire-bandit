# 🐚 Bandit - OverTheWire: My Ethical Hacking Journey

Welcome to my repository! This project documents my journey through the **Bandit** wargame by [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). The goal is to learn the basics of **Linux shell**, **information security**, and **command-line tools** in a practical and progressive way.

## 🎯 Purpose

**Bandit** is designed for beginners in cybersecurity. Across 34 levels (from *Level 0* to *Level 33*), it teaches how to work with files, processes, network connections, and solve challenges using the command line.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository includes: 
- `README.md` – The main file that describes the overall purpose, setupe and usage of the project
- `level0.md`, `level1.md`,... : The exact commands I used to solve the level

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Linux Terminal (bash/zsh)**
- **SSH**
- **Netcat (nc)**
- **Common tools** like `find`, `grep`, `strings`, `file`, `base64`, etc.
